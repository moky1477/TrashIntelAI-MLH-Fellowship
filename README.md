# TrashIntel AI

TrashIntel AI is a machine learning-based waste classification and reward system that encourages users to collect garbage and keep their surroundings clean. The project uses computer vision to classify dry and wet waste, and provides rewards to users for their efforts in collecting and disposing of garbage. Additionally, users can send their location to the admin/garbage collector to request garbage collection.

## Features

- Waste classification: The machine learning model can distinguish between dry and wet waste, which helps users know how to dispose of garbage properly.
- Reward system: Users receive rewards in the form of points as they collect garbage. Points can be redeemed for various incentives, such as discounts or coupons.
- Location-based garbage collection: Users can send their location to the admin/garbage collector to request garbage collection. This helps ensure that garbage is collected promptly and efficiently.
- User-friendly interface: The application has a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to use and navigate.
